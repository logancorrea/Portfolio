## Introduction
Utah is home to several fault zones including one along the Wasatch front where nearly 80% of the population lives. Experts estimate that a 6.75 or greater magnitude earthquake will take place in the next 50 years in Utah. To help Utahns prepare this article looks into the history of earthquakes in Utah, what a major earthquake could look like, and what residents can do to be safe during the next earthquake.

## Understanding Earthquakes
### What Are Earthquakes and Why Do They Matter?
Earthquakes are natural phenomena caused by the sudden release of energy within the Earth’s crust. This release occurs when tectonic plates—massive slabs of rock that make up the Earth’s outer shell—shift against one another, creating seismic waves. These waves are what we feel as the ground shakes beneath our feet. But earthquakes are more than just a geological curiosity; they have profound implications for communities and ecosystems around the globe. USGS

Why do earthquakes matter? The answer lies in their potential to cause widespread damage. Beyond the immediate shaking of the ground, earthquakes can lead to landslides, tsunamis, and soil liquefaction—where the ground behaves like a liquid. Infrastructure, such as bridges, buildings, and roads, often suffers severe damage, disrupting transportation, utilities, and communication systems. Economically, recovery from an earthquake can cost billions of dollars, impacting local and even national economies for years. More importantly, earthquakes directly affect lives, claiming thousands of lives annually and displacing millions globally. OUR WORLD IN DATA

Understanding the mechanics of earthquakes and their potential consequences is crucial, especially for regions like Utah, which sits on the seismically active Intermountain Seismic Belt (ISB). This knowledge not only helps scientists predict the potential risks but also aids communities in preparing for and mitigating the devastating effects of these natural disasters.

### Historical Earthquakes in Utah

Utah’s seismic history illustrates the region’s vulnerability and provides insights into the potential impacts of future events. The state has experienced several notable earthquakes, each leaving its mark on communities and shaping preparedness efforts.

1901 Richfield Earthquake: The most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Utah occurred on November 13, 1901, near the town of Richfield. With an estimated magnitude between 6.5 and 6.7, this earthquake caused intense shaking that was felt across central Utah. Significant damage was reported in Richfield and nearby towns, where many brick structures could not withstand the force and crumbled. Fortunately, due to the region’s sparse population at the time, the number of casualties was minimal. WIKIPEDIA

1934 Hansel Valley Earthquake: Another significant quake occurred on March 12, 1934, with a magnitude of 6.6. The Hansel Valley Earthquake caused surface ruptures and extensive shaking. Although there were only two reported fatalities, the quake emphasized the potential for destruction, especially in urban areas. WIKIPEDIA

1962 Cache Valley Earthquake: Among Utah’s most destructive seismic events, the Cache Valley earthquake on August 30, 1962, demonstrated the devastating potential of moderate-sized earthquakes. With a magnitude of 5.7, the quake caused widespread damage, particularly in the town of Richmond, where up to 75% of homes suffered structural harm. DISASTER STORY

2020 Magna Earthquake: More recently, on March 18, 2020, a magnitude 5.7 earthquake occurred near Magna, just west of Salt Lake City. This event caused significant shaking along the Wasatch Front, resulting in damage to buildings, and infrastructure, and a temporary shutdown of the Salt Lake City International Airport. WIKIPEDIA

These historical earthquakes reveal the potential for significant seismic activity in Utah and underscore the importance of continued vigilance and proactive planning. While the state has not yet faced a catastrophic urban earthquake, the risks remain real, particularly given the increasing population along the Wasatch Front.

## The Looming Threat of a Major Earthquake in Utah
### Expert Predictions and the Challenges of Earthquake Forecasting

The risk of a major earthquake in Utah is not a question of “if” but “when,” as scientific research consistently shows. Utah sits atop the Wasatch Fault, a massive 240-mile-long fault system that runs through the Wasatch Front, home to nearly 80% of the state’s population. The Working Group on Utah Earthquake Probabilities (WGUEP) estimates a 43% probability of one or more magnitude 6.75 or greater earthquakes and a 57% probability of one or more magnitude 6.0 or greater earthquakes occurring within the Wasatch Front region over the next 50 years. These predictions are based on extensive geological studies, including trench investigations that analyze sediment layers disrupted by past quakes, revealing fault activity patterns over thousands of years.

Despite these insights, accurately predicting the exact timing of an earthquake remains a significant challenge. Unlike weather forecasting, earthquake prediction is hindered by the unpredictable nature of stress buildup and release along faults. The gradual accumulation of tectonic stress occurs over centuries, and there are no reliable warning signs indicating precisely when the stress will reach a breaking point.

### The Energy and Destruction Potential of Earthquakes
The immense energy released during an earthquake is what makes these natural events so destructive. Earthquake strength is measured using the moment magnitude scale, which quantifies the energy released based on the size of the fault area, the amount of slip along the fault, and the rigidity of the surrounding rock. This scale is logarithmic, meaning that each whole-number increase represents roughly 32 times more energy released. For example, a magnitude 7 earthquake releases 32 times more energy than a magnitude 6 and nearly 1,000 times more than a magnitude 5. USGS

To put this into perspective, a magnitude 7 earthquake releases energy equivalent to the detonation of approximately 500,000 tons of TNT, or about 33 times the energy released by the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, which was estimated at 15,000 tons of TNT. This colossal force translates into intense ground shaking capable of toppling buildings, fracturing roadways, and damaging critical infrastructure like water lines and power grids. The destruction extends beyond structural damage; landslides, liquefaction, and fires caused by ruptured gas lines often compound the devastation.

PLOT

Figure 2. This figure illustrates the relationship between earthquake magnitude and energy release, measured in tons of TNT. Highlighted are significant Utah earthquakes, including the 2020 Magna earthquake (6,700 tons of TNT) and the 1901 Richfield earthquake. It models a potential Wasatch Front earthquake (2020–2070) with a magnitude of 6.75+, releasing nearly 220,000 tons of TNT.

Understanding the relationship between magnitude and energy release underscores the importance of preparing for high-magnitude events. Even a moderate earthquake in the magnitude 5 range, like the 2020 Magna earthquake, caused notable shaking and damage. A larger earthquake, such as one exceeding magnitude 7, would result in exponentially greater destruction, posing a catastrophic threat to life and property along the Wasatch Front.

## Who is at Risk?

### Geographic Vulnerabilities
Utah lies in a seismically active region, with numerous fault lines concentrated along the Wasatch Front, a corridor that includes major population centers such as Salt Lake City, Provo, and Ogden. The Wasatch Fault, spanning approximately 240 miles, is one of the most significant active faults in the United States. This fault system runs directly through or near these urban areas, placing over 80% of Utah's population at risk from potential earthquakes. Experts predict that a major earthquake (magnitude 6.5 or higher) is overdue in this region, given its historical activity and the long intervals since the last major events. The proximity of these fault lines to densely populated areas amplifies the potential for widespread damage to infrastructure, homes, and essential services, making earthquake preparedness and mitigation strategies critical for the state.

PLOT

Figure 3. This map overlays fault lines on a population density heatmap of Utah. Darker red areas represent higher population densities, concentrated along the Wasatch Front, which aligns closely with major fault lines.

Sediment liquefaction poses a significant risk in Utah, particularly along the Wasatch Front, where loose, water-saturated sediments are prevalent. During an earthquake, the intense shaking can cause these sediments to lose their strength and behave like a liquid temporarily. This phenomenon is most likely to occur in areas with shallow water tables and unconsolidated sands and silts, conditions common in valley regions such as the Salt Lake Valley. Liquefaction can lead to severe ground deformation, sinking, or tilting of structures, and the failure of buried utilities, exacerbating the damage caused by an earthquake. The high population density and concentration of critical infrastructure in liquefaction-prone areas heighten the potential for economic loss and human impact, underscoring the need for robust land-use planning and construction practices to mitigate this hazard. The visualization below shows the liquefaction risk of houses within the Salt Lake Valley.

PLOT

Figure 4. This map illustrates the liquefaction risk for housing units across Salt Lake County, with darker red shades indicating higher liquefaction potential. The highest-risk areas are concentrated along the valley floor, aligning with densely populated regions and highlighting vulnerabilities to seismic activity.

### Building Risks
Older buildings in Utah, particularly those constructed before the adoption of modern seismic building codes in 1975, are highly susceptible to damage during earthquakes. Many of these pre-1975 structures are built with unreinforced masonry (URM), which lacks the flexibility and reinforcement needed to withstand intense seismic shaking. This design flaw makes them prone to cracking, partial collapse, or even total failure, posing significant risks to occupants and bystanders. Along the Wasatch Front, a substantial number of schools, commercial buildings, and historic landmarks were built before this critical regulatory change, heightening the vulnerability of these communities. Retrofitting these older buildings with seismic reinforcements, such as steel braces, shear walls, and improved foundations, is essential to reduce the risk of widespread damage and casualties during a seismic event. The treemap below shows that Salt Lake City, Murray, and Midvale are particularly vulnerable due to the majority of their homes being constructed before 1975.

PLOT

Figure 5. This treemap shows housing units in Salt Lake County cities, categorized by construction year. In Salt Lake City, the majority of houses were built before 1975, indicating higher vulnerability to earthquake damage. In contrast, other cities, such as Sandy and South Jordan, have a greater proportion of newer, less vulnerable homes built after 1975.

## Preparing for the Worst
### Lessons from Other Regions
There is an often-repeated saying, "earthquakes don't kill people, buildings do"”(FEMA). Using modern building codes protects lives during natural disasters. In February of 2023 a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Turkey and Syria. Nearly 60,000 people were killed largely due to weak infrastructure not built to code. This brought to the forefront the importance of enforcing building codes and making sure the codes in place are well researched to protect individuals during natural disasters (PBS). On the flip side after the 1995 Kobe earthquake in Japan, the country doubled down on their efforts to make buildings more earthquake proof. This included research, funding, and enforcement of the new codes. These codes have saved lives (New York Times).

### Practical Tips for Utah Residents
According to FEMA 65% of the U.S. has not adopted modern building codes. Before an earthquake takes place in the state of Utah residents can become educated on whether places in their communities are enforcing modern building codes. Even if a home was built after 1975 it may not have been built to code so it’s important to investigate before purchasing. Children spend most of their days during the school year in schools. Taking action to ensure building codes are enforced and that school buildings are safe are two things residents of Utah can do to prepare for the next major earthquake. Before an earthquake it is also important to create an emergency plan. Having an emergency preparedness plan includes knowing what to do during a natural disaster and designating a meeting spot if you are split up from your family. It also means having extra food and water stored. In school you may have practiced the drop, cover, and hold on drill. It may have seemed like a nuisance at the time, but it is the most effective way to protect yourself during an earthquake. Drop, cover, and hold on means to get to the ground so you don’t fall over and get injured, cover your head and neck with your hands, and get under something sturdy and hold on to it (Earthquakes.utah.gov, Red Cross).

## Conclusion: What the Data Tells Us

The data reveals the seismic vulnerability of Utah, particularly the Wasatch Front, which is home to a large portion of the state’s population. Visualizations of fault lines and seismic hazard maps underscore the immediate risk posed by the Wasatch Fault, which runs through or near major urban centers like Salt Lake City, Provo, and Ogden. The proximity of over 80% of the population to these fault lines amplifies the potential consequences of a major earthquake. Historical earthquake data further supports this, showing that Utah has experienced significant seismic events in the past, and experts predict a high likelihood of another large-scale earthquake within the next few decades. Understanding the geographic distribution of fault lines, sediment liquefaction zones, and vulnerable buildings is critical for grasping the full scope of risk in the state. The insights provided by these data points demonstrate that the potential for widespread damage is not just theoretical but a very real concern

Proactive preparation is vital for mitigating the destructive impact of an earthquake in Utah. The data shows that the most vulnerable regions are concentrated along the Wasatch Front, which also happens to be where the majority of the population lives. As highlighted in the historical accounts and expert predictions, the risk of a major earthquake is not speculative—it is a matter of when not if. The economic and human costs of recovery from past earthquakes, both in Utah and globally, emphasize the need for urgent action. Building preparedness—such as retrofitting older buildings, improving infrastructure resilience, and establishing early warning systems—can significantly reduce the scale of damage and loss of life. The visualizations and data clearly show that areas with high population density, poor soil stability (due to liquefaction), and outdated construction are most at risk, making it essential to implement targeted strategies to strengthen these vulnerable zones. As seismic activity is unpredictable, waiting until an earthquake occurs is too late. Utah must act now to ensure it is as prepared as possible when the "Big One" strikes.
